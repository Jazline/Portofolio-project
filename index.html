    Welcome to my Portofolio.I hope you can learn as much about me and appreciate the work I have done.<br>
    I am originally from West Africa more precisely the Ivory Coast, I came to the US about 5 years ago to attend college at the University of Central Arkansas.<br>
    While in college my major was Finance ,much of the decision was influenced by my parents because I also did not know what I truly wanted to do.Once I got my diploma, I moved to Austin,Texas
    I fell immediately in love with the city and as I researched more and talked to people I saw the increasing demand for people with a tech background,this is why I took a leap of faith
    to register for this bootcamp.
</p>
<p>
    On a typical Saturday you would find me dolled up and exploring different restaurants and 'instagrammable' places in Austin.I love the food diversity the city has and the art walls all around the city.
    I also like watching shows on Netflix and right now I am trying to watch "The Office".It seems like everyone in America grew up on that show and I miss out on conversations when I don't know in what episode Dwight did something particular.
    I am also a believer in God and thus take my faith journey seriously so you would also find me watching sermons on Youtube and also have lunch,life group and book club meetings with my fellow church members.
    My goal by the end of this class is to be able to have a full grasp of all the languages I will learn and be able to apply them in my future role as a Software developer.
